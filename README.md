## Usage

I have only developed the server part yet, and maybe you need to install some addups to run 
this proxy successfully.

1. Config your proxy settings and set the IP address to 127.0.0.1, then choose a port as you
 like.
2. Execute 'python server.py'
3. Input 127.0.0.1 and the port you have chosen.
4. Enjoy!
